The solution involved identifying a memory leak within a specific component that used a library for image manipulation and caching. The component was not properly clearing its internal cache when the component was unmounted, causing memory buildup with each successive navigation. To correct this, we added a cleanup function within the component's `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method (or its React equivalent useEffect cleanup function). The cleanup function was responsible for clearing the image cache.  Additionally, we added logging statements to carefully observe memory usage during the app's lifecycle. This involved using React's state management or a logging library to track memory usage at key points, particularly after component unmounts.  After making these changes, the iOS crashes were eliminated and app stability was improved.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Image } from 'expo-image-picker'; // Or relevant image library

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [imageCache, setImageCache] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    // ... image loading and caching logic ...
    return () => {
      // Clean up the cache when the component unmounts
      Image.cache.clear(); //Or similar for your image library
      setImageCache({});
    };
  }, []);

  // ... rest of the component ...
};
```
