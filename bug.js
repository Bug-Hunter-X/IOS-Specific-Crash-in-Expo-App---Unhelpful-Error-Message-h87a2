While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual error where the app would crash on iOS devices, specifically iPhones, but function correctly on Android. The error message in the iOS logs was not specific or helpful, simply stating 'Application terminated unexpectedly'. The issue only appeared after certain actions within the app, such as navigating between screens multiple times or interacting with certain components.  The Android version showed no such problems, which led me to believe it might be something related to iOS-specific handling of resources or background processes, or a particular Expo module interaction. The code itself appeared correct, passing all linting checks and no obvious runtime errors were visible.
